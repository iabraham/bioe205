## Course Information & Resources

**Credit:** 3 hours. \\
**Prerequisite:** [CS 101](https://courses.illinois.edu/schedule/2023/spring/CS/101) or 
[CS 124](https://courses.illinois.edu/schedule/2023/spring/CS/124),
[PHYS 212](https://courses.illinois.edu/schedule/2023/spring/PHYS/212), and credit or 
concurrent registration in [MATH 285](https://courses.illinois.edu/schedule/2023/spring/MATH/28). \\


**Required Textbook:** [Circuits, Signals and Systems for Bioengineers](https://www.sciencedirect.com/book/9780128093955/circuits-signals-and-systems-for-bioengineers) (_available for download at no cost from ScienceDirect using UIUC credentials_)

~~~
<p style="color:red;">The textbook is hereafter also referred to as CSSB.</p>
~~~
**Supplementary Textbook:** [Engineering Signals and
Systems](https://ss2.eecs.umich.edu) \\

**Software:** We will primarily use the required textbook for class. Therefore,
you will need access to MATLAB. Optionally you may opt to use Python to
complete the course requirements[^1].

* MATLAB is available on [Engineering WorkStation](https://engrit.illinois.edu/ews) computers or via [Citrix](https://engrit.illinois.edu/services/instructional-services/remote-connections-citrix). 

* Python is available in a cloud-based notebook format with any Google account on [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com). For local installations you have [many options](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/stable/user-guide/install/download.html).

**LMS:** We will make extensive use of [Ed](https://edstem.org/us/join/ngTUR5) and [Gradescope](). 

> **Note:** Official announcements will be done through **Ed**. You will be held responsible for content in announcements made on there. **Make sure** that you are:
> 1. Enrolled in the course on Ed, and \\
> 1. Have some method to stay up-to-date with course announcements.

## Course Objectives
Course objectives & outcomes can be found on the [homepage.](/#course_outcomes)

## Homework
Homework is due at the beginning of class on the due date via [Gradescope]().
**No late homework will be accepted**. To account for any personal events, 
emergencies or unforeseen circumstances, the lowest homework grade will be dropped. 

Generally, no exceptions will be made to the above policy or any extensions
given. In case of an event that greatly interferes with your ability to
complete assignments this semester, grading will be determined by the
University policy on such extenuating circumstances.

Assignments can be found [here.](/homework#assignments)

## Midterms and Exams
There will be **two** midterms for this course and a **final exam** as
scheduled by the Registrar's office. Please see the course schedule for
tentative contents of the exams. 

 - **E1:** Exam 1 on February 20, 1700 - 1820 hrs, [1SIEBL
   1404](https://www.campus-maps.com/uiuc/siebel-center-for-computer-sci/)
 - **E2**: Exam 2 on April 03, 1700 - 1820 hrs, [1SIEBL
   1404](https://www.campus-maps.com/uiuc/siebel-center-for-computer-sci/)
 - **FE**: Final Exam as per the [registrar.](https://registrar.illinois.edu/courses-grades/final-exam-schedule-public/)

The final exam details will be posted once the registrar releases the final
exam schedule. 

A conflict exam will only be offered by policy if another exam or course in which
the student is enrolled occurs at the same time as the BIOE 205 exam. Please
note that documentation about the conflict from the other course’s instructor will
be required. 

Illinois law requires the University to reasonably accommodate its students'
religious beliefs, observances, and practices in regard to admissions, class
attendance, and the scheduling of examinations and work requirements. You
should examine this syllabus at the beginning of the semester for potential
conflicts between course deadlines and any of your religious observances. If a
conflict exists, you should notify your instructor of the conflict and [follow
the procedure](https://odos.illinois.edu/community-of-
care/resources/students/religious-observances/) to request appropriate
accommodations. This should be done in the first two weeks of classes.

All other instances will be handled on a case by case basis and will require
appropriate documentation (note from McKinley, DRES letter, etc. ) and
approvals (relevant ampus unit). 


## Course Schedule
The tentative course schedule based on a 15-week semester is as follows. The
readings are from CSSB and you are responsible for it.  

\tableinput{}{./schedule.csv}

## Grading

Grading is broken down as follows. 

| Midterm 1	| Midterm 2	| Final 	| Homework	| Project	| Participation |
| :----:	| :----:	| :----:	| :----:	| :----:	| :----:	|
| 20 %   	| 20 %   	| 20 %   	| 20 %     	| 15 %    	|  5 %          |

Peer reviews may be used to evaluate participation of group work.
Unprofessional behavior may reduce the final grade by up to 5 points per
offense — in addition to any other sanctions. 

The following grading scale is guaranteed; however, based upon student
performance, final grades *may* be curved.

| Grade | Score  | Grade | Score | Grade | Score  | Grade | Score  |
|-------|--------|-------|-------|-------|--------|-------|--------|
| A+    | ≥ 94   | B+    | ≥ 83  | C+    | ≥ 73   | D+    | ≥ 64   |
| A     | ≥ 91   | B     | ≥ 80  | C     | ≥ 70   | D     | ≥ 60   |
| A-    | ≥ 87   | B-    | ≥ 77  | C-    | ≥ 67   | D-    | ≥ 55   |

In-class activities held about once per week will primarily count towards your
participation scores. 

## Project 

As noted above, there will be a group project worth 15% of your final grade. It
will involve modeling a biosystem and/or biosignal analysis in MATLAB. More
information about the projects can be found [here.](/project/)

## Academic Conduct

The usual academic integrity policies apply. You are expected to behave in a
professional & ethical manner and your work should be your own. At minimum,
plagiarism or cheating will result in a zero for the relevant assignment. More
severe ethical violations can warrant further penalties including a failing
grade. Details can be found in:

* [Quick Reference Guide](https://provost.illinois.edu/policies/policies/academic-integrity/students-quick-reference-guide-to-academic-integrity/)
* [Student Code](https://studentcode.illinois.edu/article1/part4/1-401/) 

## Disability-Related Accommodations
To obtain disability-related academic adjustments and/or auxiliary aids,
students with disabilities must contact the course instructor and the
Disability Resources and Educational Services (DRES) as soon as possible. If
you are concerned you have a disability-related condition that is impacting
your academic progress, there are academic screening appointments available
that can help diagnosis a previously undiagnosed disability. Please find
resources available by visiting the [DRES website](https://www.disability.illinois.edu).


## Inclusivity & Diversity 

The Grainger College of Engineering is committed to the creation of an
anti-racist, inclusive community that welcomes diversity along a number of
dimensions, including, but not limited to, race, ethnicity and national
origins, gender and gender identity, sexuality, disability status, class, age,
or religious beliefs.

The success of this course depends on each of us creating a supportive and safe
learning environment that promotes free discussion and ensures that everyone
has an equal opportunity to succeed. Everyone is expected to contribute to
creating and sustaining a climate where employees, instructors, and students
may work together without being concerned about personal ridicule, or being
exposed to inappropriate or intolerable language. You are invited to notify the
course director of any instances of racism, discrimination, microaggressions,
or other offensive behavior if you feel safe doing so.

You can also report these behaviors to the [Office of the Vice
Chancellor for Diversity, Equity &
Inclusion](https://diversity.illinois.edu/diversity-campus-culture/belonging-resources/).
Based on your report, they will follow up and reach out to students to
make sure they have the support they need to be healthy and safe.

## Community of Care
As members of the Illinois community, we each have a responsibility to express
care and concern for one another and we want to support you in your overall
wellness. We know that students sometimes face challenges that can impact
academic performance (examples include mental health concerns, food insecurity,
homelessness, personal emergencies). The University of Illinois offers a
variety of services addressing student needs at no additional cost. We
encourage you to be aware of these resources by visiting the
[website](https://odos.illinois.edu/community-of-care/) and familiarizing
yourself various mechanisms in place to help students in need. 

## Campus Emergency Policy

In the event of a major campus emergency, course requirements, deadlines, and
grading percentages are subject to changes that may be necessitated by a
revised semester calendar or other circumstances.

Please review the run, hide, fight
[handout](https://police.illinois.edu/wp-content/uploads/syllabus-attachment.pdf) and
[video](https://mediaspace.illinois.edu/media/t/1_bbti3ec5) provided on campus for
information from the U of I Police Department. Additional emergency response
recommendations can be found at this
[website](https://police.illinois.edu/em/run-hide-fight/). It is good
practice to review [campus building floor
plans](http://police.illinois.edu/emergency-preparedness/building-emergency-action-plans/.)
on their website within the first 10 days of class.
