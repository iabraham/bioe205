## Catalog Description

> Introduction to signals and linear systems with examples from biology and
> medicine. Linear systems and mathematical models of systems, including
> differential equations, convolution, Laplace transforms, Fourier series and
> transforms, and discrete representations. In class examples and coursework apply
> general techniques to problems in biological signal analysis, including
> circuits, enzyme kinematics, and physiological system analysis. Use of MATLAB
> and Simulink software to understand more complex systems.

### Course Outcomes

By the end of class, students will be able to â€¦

1. Understand the concepts of systems and signal representations.
1. Use different mathematical tools to model physical and biomedical/biological
   phenomena and systems (i.e., differential equations, convolution, and signal
   transforms).
1. Apply linear systems methods (i.e., convolution, Fourier analysis, and
   Laplace analysis) to characterize these models and calculate analytical
   solutions.
1. Approximate biomedical signals with mathematical functions.
1. Convert between time-domain, frequency-domain, and Laplace-domain
   representations of biomedical signals & systems and understand what can be
   learned from the representation.
1. Understand the limits of different models and signal representations.
1. Use MATLAB/Python to find computational solutions to linear systems.
