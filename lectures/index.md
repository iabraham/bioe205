# Lecture notes

This page links to lectures notes that will be posted once per week and are
supposed to supplement the textbook and lecture slides used in class. 

Each of these notes will correspond roughly to two (maximum three) in-class
lectures.

\note{These notes are by no means perfect; they are being written up for the
first time and a work-in-progress. There might be a plethora of typos or
unintentional mistakes peppered through them. Please point them out or bring
them up.}

\caution{These notes are intentionally **not** mathematically rigorous due to
various reasons (breadth of topics to cover, curriculum plan, etc.). The
more mathematically inclined student can find far more meticulous & precise 
treatment of the subject matter elsewhere.}
