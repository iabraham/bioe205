# Lecture notes

This page links to lectures notes that will be posted once per week and are
supposed to supplement the textbook and lecture slides used in class. 

Each of these notes will correspond roughly to two (maximum three) in-class
lectures. 

1. [Lecture notes 01](lec01)
1. [Lecture notes 02](lec02)
1. [Lecture notes 03](lec03)
1. [Lecture notes 04](lec04)
1. [Lecture notes 05](lec05)

These notes are by no means perfect; and there might be a plethora of typos or
unintentional mistakes peppered through them. Please point them out or bring
them up.
