# Lecture 12

> **Reading material:** Chapter 6 of CSSB

Last lecture, we spent a considerable amount of time  discussing the frequency
response of a system, the meaning of the system spectrum, analytically
computing the system response to sinusoid inputs, simple block diagram algebra,
etc. We ended the lecture discussing a systematic way to draw magnitude & phase
diagrams given a system transfer function using the Bode plot technique. We
continue this thread in this lecture.

## Block diagram algebra 

We discussed in class some basic rules of block diagram manipulation and
algebra. These notes are available [here](/inclass/mar09/). 

\note{While not part of the lecture notes per the techniques in the link above
are important topics and fair game on exams/quizzes}. 

\warn{Ignore block digram algebra at your own risk}.
