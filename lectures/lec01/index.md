## Systems concepts

A system can be thought of as a collection or set of interconnected components
and processes that work together to achieve some goal. This goal might be as
varied as providing energy to the body (the task of the digestive system) to
assuring optimal body temperature for physiological process (thermoregulatory
system). 

We are already familiar with various systems in the body, e.g., the respiratory
system, the circulatory system, the endocrine system, etc. and what their
primary functions are. In traditional western medicine, different specialities
like cardiology, neurology, ophthalmology, etc., are often centered around
various physiological systems in the human body. 

### System diagrams & signals

Systems are often represented as *system diagrams*, which are useful abstract
representations of underlying processes as input/output maps. 

\fig{iosystem.png}

For example, our thermoregulatory system can take the ambient temperature as
the input, and then decide to activate the sweat glands in our body, so as to
maintain our core body temperature at a level suitable for our physiological
processes. Then in the above diagram, the stimulus or input would have been the
increase in ambient temperature while the output/response would have been the
activation of the sweat glands. 

The various systems within the human body vary vastly in size and function.
Nevertheless, despite these differences, there must exist a way for these systems to
communicate within their various subsystems as well as with the outside world.
This is achieved using *signals* which encode information, typically by varying
their "energy" content. Within the body, these are often called _biosignals_
and the variation, _specific energy fluctuations_. 

Table 1.1 of the textbook lists a few types of these. 

| Energy | Variable Measured | Biosignal |
|--------|-------------------|-----------|
| Chemical | Chemical activity and/or concentration | Blood ions, O2, CO2, pH, hormonal concentrations, and other chemistry |
| Mechanical | Position, force, torque, or pressure | Muscle movement; Cardiovascular pressures, muscle contractility; Valve and other cardiac sounds |
| Electrical | Voltage, current | EEG, ECG, EMG, EOG, ERG, EGG, GSR |
| Thermal | Temperature | Body temperature, thermography |

### Transducers & biotransducers

A device that is capable of converting between different types of energy is
called _transducer_. Thus, generators and motors and piezoelectrics are all
transducers. However, within the realm of signal processing, by a transducer we
often mean a device that is used to convert information encoded using one form
of energy, to another form. That is to say, the primary objective, of a
biotransducer, is _not_ energy conversion, but rather information processing.
For example, a force sensor coupled with an EMG device might convert force
exerted at the transducer to electrical energy, which allows for measuring the
levels of force; say by way of voltage. However, both 0 N and 1000 N of force
can get mapped to a 0 - 5V range, thus making the transducer a very inefficient
energy conversion device. When making physiological measurements, by default
all biosignals are converted to electrical signals for further processing using
_biotransducers_.

Biotransducers are critical elements in systems because the accuracy and
resolution of any measurement made on a physiological process depends on them.
Typically, there are three strategies to make measurements from physiological
systems. 

- A biotransducer is used to detect energy/signal generated within the body
  (thermometer, pulse-oximeter, etc.)

- An external source of energy is used to turn the body into a signal source
  (PET, MRI, etc.)
- An external signal source's variation is measured as it passes through the
  body (e.g., x-rays).  

The table below lists a few biotransducers that convert physiological signals
to electrical ones. 

|Acronym | Full form 		| Organ involved | 
|--------|----------------------|----------------|
| ECG    | electrocardiogram    | heart 	 |
| EEG    | electroencephalogram | brain  	 |
| EMG    | electromyogram 	| muscle 	 |
| EOG    | electrooculogram 	| eye 		 |
| ERG    | electroretinogram 	| retina 	 |
| EGG    | electrogastrogram 	| stomach	 |

## Signal representation & encoding

Recall that signals encode information by way of variations in their energy
content. Typically, for one-dimensional signals, these variations are captured
in their _amplitude_ and _frequency_. Thus, the same signal can be equivalently 
represented in the _time domain_ or in the _frequency domain_ (the subject of
Chapter 3 and 4 in the textbook). However, since we are in the computer age, we
first focus on the difference between continuous (also called analog)
signals and discrete (also called digital) signals.[^1]

### Analog vs. Digital signals 

Recall a signal $f(t)$ may be mathematically represented as a mapping 
\begin{align*}
f: D  & \mapsto R \\
   t  & \mapsto f(t)
\end{align*}

from a _domain_ $D$ to its _range_ $R$. The distinction between analog and
digital signals lies in whether $D\subseteq \mathbb{R}$ or $D \subseteq
\mathbb{Z}$, i.e. the real line or the integers. 

For example, suppose a temperature transducer encodes room temperature into 
voltage as shown in the table below:

| Temperature (Celsius) | Voltage (Volts) |
|-----------------------|-----------------|
| -10.0                 | 0.0             |
| 0.0                   | 5.0             |
| 10.0                  | 10.0            |
| 20.0                  | 15.0            |

Then the ensuing encoding equation for temperature $T$ in terms of voltage $V$
is: \begin{equation*} T = 2 \times V - 10 \end{equation*}
It is clear that for this particular application and encoding scheme, $V, T \in
\mathbb{R}$ and thus are continuous signals. 

For use in a computer or digital applications, continuous signals must be
converted into a series of numbers through a process called _sampling_. 

[\input{plot}{sampling}](/assets/lectures/lec01/code/sampling.jl)

This typically involves partitioning the domain $[t_0, t_f] = D \subseteq
\mathbb{R}$ into equally sized intervals $I_k = [t_0 + (k-1)T_s, t_0 + kT_s ],
k = 1, 2, \dots $ and recording the value of the signal at the end points of
the constituent intervals. Then $T_s$ is called the _sampling interval_ and the
$n=\lfloor \dfrac{t_f - t_0}{T_s} \rfloor $ sequential numbers represent the
discrete version of the analog signal $f$. The _sampling frequency_ is the
reciprocal of $T_s$. 

[\input{plot}{discrete}](/assets/lectures/lec01/code/discrete.jl)

The above signal $f[k]$ is a discrete version of the continuous signal $f(t)$
and is represented in the computer by a sequence or _array_ of numbers. To
avoid specifying the domain of the argument of $f$ each time, it is convenient
to adopt the notation $f(t)$ for continuous signals and $f[k]$ for digital
signals. Note that, since computers can only represent digital signals,
typically an analog-to-digital conversion also involves a partitioning of the
_range_ of $f(t)$ as well. 

\collaps{**Example:** An 12-bit analog-to-digital converter (ADC) advertises an
accuracy of Â± the least significant bit (LSB). If the input range of the ADC is
0 to 10 volts, what is the accuracy of the ADC in analog volts}{If the input
range is 10 volts then the analog voltage represented by the LSB would be: 
\nonumber{$$
V_{LSB} = \dfrac{V_{max}}{2^{12}} = \dfrac{10}{4096} = 0.0024 V $$ }}

The relationship between a continuous signal and its discrete counterpart is
not an exact one; indeed the conditions necessary for the existence of a
meaningful relationship between a continuous signal and its discrete version
are described in Chapter 4. 

(For now we will assume that all computer-based
signals used in examples and problems are accurate representations of their
associated continuous signals.)

### Frequency domain vs. Time domain
As mentioned earlier, signals admit equivalent frequency and time domain
representations. The time-domain graph shows how a signal changes over time,
whereas a frequency-domain graph shows how much of the signal lies within each
given frequency band over a range of frequencies. A complete frequency-domain
representation also includes information on the phase shift that must be applied
to sinusoids at each frequency in order to be able to recombine[^2] the components
and recover the original time signal. 

[\input{plot}{eeg}](/assets/lectures/lec01/code/eeg.jl)

The figure above (c.f. Figure 1.7 from the textbook) shows an EEG time-domain signal
(on the left) transformed into its magnitude and phase frequency-domain
representations. The magnitude does show some interesting features: peaks
around 1-3 Hz and 16-18 Hz, and a large peak around 7-8 Hz. These peaks in
frequency are [well
known](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroencephalography#Comparison_of_EEG_bands)
to neurologists.

In later lectures (corresponding to Chapters 3 and 4 in the textbook) we will
learn techniques for moving between different types and representations of
signals (time domain $\Leftrightarrow$ frequency domain and continuous time
$\Leftrightarrow$ discrete time). The figure below summarizes these
transformations.

## Images as signals

Digital image signals are typically represented as two-dimensional (2D) arrays
of discrete signal samples, commonly termed matrices[^3]. Therefore, images can
often be treated with the same mathematical analyses as signals although some
techniques need to be specially extended to two dimensional data.  

In most scientific programming languages, images are represented no different
from normal numeric arrays. This means that standard mathematical operations 
can be applied to an image; conceptually the image is just another matrix to 
MATLAB/NumPy/Julia. The code below shows some basic mathematical and
threshold operations applied to an MR image of the brain. Note that you will
need to download the [`brain.mat`](/assets/matlab/brain.mat) file from the companion 
[website](https://www.elsevier.com/books-and-journals/book-companion/9780128093955)

[^1]: The textbooks also makes a big distinction between 1-dimensional (time-series) and 2-dimensional signals (images), a convention which we will avoid because the time index (be it discrete or continuous) is almost always subsumed into the columns of a multi-dimensional signal for signal processing applications. 
[^2]: This is the essence of [Fourier transforms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform) as we will see in Chapter 3 of CSSB. 
[^3]: Strictly speaking, this is only true for grayscale images since color images are actually multidimensional arrays; i.e. matrices stacked together, one matrix per color channel (R-red, G-green, B-blue)
