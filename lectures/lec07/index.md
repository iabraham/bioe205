# Lecture 07

> **Reading material:** Section 3.1 - 3.3 of CSSB.

#### Recap 
All of last lecture we spent building up intuition on what Fourier expansions
and series do for us. The takeaway was that Fourier series represents a
continuous periodic function in terms of a new basis of sines and cosines, the
Fourier transform was the extension of this to aperiodic signals which allowed
us to move between the time domain and frequency domain representations. 

In this lecture we will work out a few examples and then present a version of
the Fourier transforms that don't involve complex numbers[^1].

## Examples


[^1]: I hesitate to call it the _real_ transform because neither is more real than the other, except maybe that the complex formulation has several advantages (compactness of notation being the least) over the real one - which we will discuss later.
