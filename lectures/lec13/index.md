# Lecture 13

> **Reading material:** Chapter 7 of CSSB

Last lecture we introduced Laplace transform as a generalization of the Fourier
Transform that is applicable to signals whose Fourier transform does not exist. 
In this lecture we spent a great deal of time learning about the Laplace
transform of basic signals and how different mathematical operations can be
translated to the _Laplace domain_. We will build a repertoire of common
Laplace and time-domain pairs and then see how we can utilize that to solve
both ordinary differential equations as well as initial value problems.
