# Lecture 10

> **Reading material:** Chapter 5 of CSSB

In the last [lecture](/lectures/lec09) we wrapped up the first part of
CSSB[^1] and from this lecture note onwards we are in the second part which is all
about analysis of systems. We start by laying the groundwork with concepts of
impulse response, frequency response and convolutions which help completely
characterize single input, single output (SISO) linear time invariant (LTI)
systems. 

\toc

## Consequences of linearity 
Recall that we loosely described linearity as the characteristic of a system
that shows "proportionality in response". More formally a system that is linear
satisfies the _additivity_ and _homogeneity_ properties. 

The latter means that if the input is scaled by some factor then so is the
output. That is, if $f$ is a system that takes a (possibly vector) input $x$
and outputs $f(x)$ then $f( \alpha x) = \alpha f(x)$ for all scalars $\alpha$.
The _additivity_ property means that when provided an input that is the
addition of two quantities, the system output can be described as the sum of
the outputs to the individual quantities, i.e. $f(x_1 + x_2) = f(x_1) +
f(x_2)$. Together, these properties are said to endow linear systems with the
[superposition
principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superposition_principle).

Thus, for linear systems and in particular linear time-invariant systems (LTI),
to understand the system's response to very complicated inputs, it suffices to
break apart the input into small manageable pieces, calculate its response to
these pieces, and then sum it all up together and this is precisely what
impulse functions let us do. 

## The impulse function

We are already familiar with the [definition](/lectures/lec04/#impulse_signal)
of the impulse function as the idealized signal $\delta(t)$ which is only nonzero at time
$t=0$ and takes on an amplitude such that 
\nonumber{$$
\int _{\mathbb{R}} \delta (x) dx = 1
$$}
One important property of the impulse function is called the _sifting_
property which is best explained as follows. Consider
$$
\int_{\mathbb{R}} f(s) \delta (s - t) ds = \int_{\mathbb{R}} f(t) \delta(s - t)
ds = f(t) \int _{\mathbb{R}} \delta(t-s) ds = f(t) 
$$
where we have used the fact that the impulse $\delta(s-t)$ is only nonzero when
$s=t$ to change $f(s)$ to $f(t)$. Then we pull it out of the integral because
it doesn't depend on the integration variable. At the final step we use the
unit area property to calculate the integral as 1. Thus ,we see that the
impulse function has the ability to pick out a single value amongst all the
values $f(t)$ could take. 

Now, we are quite familiar with the notion of changing to the frequency domain
via the Fourier transform as a change of basis to complex exponentials or
equivalently to sinusoid. Then, let us take a step back and ask the
following question. 

\collaps{**Question:** If the basis in the frequency domain was sinusoids or complex
exponentials, what was the basis in the time domain to begin with?}{Recall that
in the case of the continuous Fourier transform, we had 
\nonumber{
$$
f(t) = \dfrac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi}} \int \limits _{-\infty} ^{\infty} F(\omega) e^{i
\omega t } d\omega 
$$}
with the interpretation being that we are synthesizing $f(t)$ by integrating over all possible
frequencies $\omega$, continuously weighted by the function $F(\omega)$. Then,
by using the impulse function $\delta (t)$ we could also write:
\nonumber{
$$ \label{pre-conv}
f(t) = \int \limits _{-\infty} ^{\infty} f(s) \delta (s-t) ds \qquad \forall t
\in \mathbb{R}
$$
We can interpret the above as an expression of $f(t)$ in terms of continuum of
"basis" functions given by $\delta(s-t)$ for each value of $t$. 
}}

As we remarked, by the principle of superposition, for linear systems it
suffices to figure out what the system's response is to individual inputs.
Since we can represent $f(t)$ in the time domain as a continuously weighted
sum/integral of the impulse function, it turns out that the response of LTI
systems to the impulse function (called the [impulse
response](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impulse_response)) characterizes its
response to any and all inputs. 

Recall that for time invariant systems, time shifting the input $x(t)$
is the same as time shifting the output $y(t)$, i.e.: $y(t-T) = f(x(t-T))$.
Therefore the above is a powerful statement that tells us we can find the
response of an LTI system to arbitrarily complex inputs by simply weighting and
summing (or integrating) its responses to a sequence of shifted impulses. 

\emphasis{An LTI system is completely characterized by its response to the
impulse function.}

### Convolution 
The operation performed in \eqref{pre-conv} is common enough in signal
processing to warrant its own name: _convolution._ Some sources denote
convolution with a $\ast$ but this is often confusing because of the wide use of
$\ast$ to denote multiplication, especially on computers. Therefore we will use
$\star$ instead.

\definition{Convolution}{The convolution of two functions $f$ and $g$ is
defined as 
$$ \label{def-conv}
f(t) \star g(t) = \int \limits _{-\infty} ^{\infty} f (\tau) g (t -
\tau) d \tau 
$$
}

Using convolution we can represent the output of any LTI system to an input
$x(t)$ using its impulse response $h(t)$ as:

$$ \label{impulseresp}
y(t) = x(t) \star h(t) = \int \limits_{-\infty} ^{\infty} x (t - \tau) \cdot
h(\tau) d\tau = \int \limits_{-\infty} ^{\infty} x (\tau) \cdot h(t-\tau) d\tau
$$

where we have used the fact that convolution operation is commutative to get
the second equality. 

\collaps{**Exercise:** Prove that the convolution operator is commutative:
\nonumber{$$
f(t) \star g(t) = g(t) \star f(t)
$$}
}{Possible homework problem.}

The astute reader may have noticed the similarity of \eqref{def-conv} with that
of the definition of the [cross
correlation](/lectures/lec05/#the_problem_with_correlation) of two functions.
Indeed one can think of convolution of $f(t)$ with $g(t)$ as the
cross-correlation of $f(t)$ with $g(-t)$ or $f(-t)$ with $g(t)$. Thus the main
difference is that in convolution, one of the signals is reversed in the time
axis. For calculating the system response, CSSB explains this reversal as:

>When implementing convolution, we reverse the input signal, because it is the input signalâ€™s smallest time value that produces the initial output.

but you might as well accept it as a definition. To see visually the difference
between convolution and cross-correlation, see below image from Wikipedia:

\input{plot}{comparison}

\note{It is imperative to understand intuitively what convolution of two
signals in the time domain looks like graphically. See this excellent
[demonstration](https://lpsa.swarthmore.edu/Convolution/CI.html).}

### Example

Let us find the convolution of $f(t) = e^{-t}$ and $g(t)=\sin(t)$. By
definition we have that 
\begin{align*}
f(t) \star g(t) &= \int \limits _{0} ^{t} e^{-\tau} \sin (t- \tau) d \tau \\
&= \left[ e^{-\tau} \cos(t-\tau) \right] _{0}^{t} - \left[ e^{-\tau} \sin (t -
\tau) \right]_0^{\tau} - \int \limits _0 ^t e^{-\tau} \sin (t - \tau ) d\tau
\end{align*}
Rearranging we have, 
\begin{align*}
2 \left( f(t) \star g(t) \right) &= \left[ e^{-\tau} \cos(t-\tau) \right]
_{0}^{t} - \left[ e^{-\tau} \sin (t - \tau) \right]_0^{\tau} \\ 
& =  e^{-t} - \cos(t) - 0 + \sin(t) \\ 
\implies f(t) \star g(t) &= \dfrac{1}{2} \left ( e^{-t} + \sin(t) - \cos(t)
\right)
\end{align*}

\note{**Discrete time**: For an example in discrete time, check Example 5.4 in
CSSB in detail.}

### Visual example(s)
The animation below shows the result of convolving two square pulses. 

\input{plot}{pulse-conv-anim}

## Impulse & convolution in the frequency domain 

The impulse function is intimately related to Fourier transform because of the
simple fact that the Fourier transform of the unit impulse function is unity.
Indeed we have that, 
$$
\mathcal{F}_{\delta}(\omega) = \int \limits _{-\infty} ^{\infty} \delta (t)
e^{-i \omega t} dt = \int \limits _{-\infty} ^{\infty} 1 \cdot e^{-i\omega t}
dt = \left. e^{-i\omega t}\right|_{t=0} = 1
$$

This is an important property of the impulse function because it allows us to
characterize the so called _spectrum of the system_. In other words, since the
impulse function has a constant amplitude across all frequencies, the system
response to the impulse response tells us exactly what it does to signals at
each frequency. 


\collaps{**Exercise:** What is the inverse Fourier transform of the frequency
domain impulse function $\delta (\omega )$?}{Left as an exercise.}

By considering the above properties we can show the below Fourier transform
pairs:

{{textableinput lectures/lec10/ft-pairs.csv}}

Now let us turn our attention to the question of what is the equivalent of the
convolution operator in the frequency domain. After all, we started this course
proclaiming that the time and frequency domain representations of signals are
equivalent. Therefore, it is only practical that we examine what happens to the
all important convolution operation used to define the time response of LTI
systems via the impulse response in the frequency domain. Let us take the
Fourier transform of the convolution of two functions:

\begin{align*}
\mathcal{F} \left( f(t) \star g(t) \right) &= \mathcal{F} \left( \int \limits _{-\infty} ^{\infty} f(\tau) g(t-\tau) d \tau   \right) \\
& = \int \limits  _{-\infty} ^{\infty} \int \limits  _{-\infty} ^{\infty}  f(\tau) g(t-\tau) d \tau  \cdot e^{-i\omega t} dt \\
& = \int \limits  _{-\infty} ^{\infty} f(\tau) \int \limits  _{-\infty} ^{\infty}  g(t-\tau)  e^{-i\omega t} dt \cdot  d \tau \\
& = \int \limits  _{-\infty} ^{\infty} f(\tau)  G(\omega) e^{-i\omega \tau} d\tau = G(\omega) \int \limits _{-\infty} ^{\infty} f(\tau) e^{-i\omega \tau} d\tau \\
& = G(\omega) F(\omega)
\end{align*}

where in the third line we changed the order of integration and in the
following line we used the fact that the Fourier transform of a time shifted
version of a function is its Fourier transform multiplied by an exponential
determined by the shift. In other words, if $X(\omega)$ is the Fourier
transform of $x(t)$ then $\mathcal{F} ( x(t- \tau) )$ is $X(\omega) \cdot
e^{-i\omega \tau}$. 

\emphasis{**Exercise:** Prove the above property about time shifts.}

Thus we see that convolution in the time domain becomes multiplication in the
Fourier domain. The reverse also holds true, namely convolution in the
frequency domain becomes multiplication in the time domain. This observation
accords us a strategy to avoid performing convolution and stick with
multiplication, to find the system response, that is, if we are willing to
tolerate an inverse Fourier transform. The strategy is as follows:

1. Take the Fourier transform of the impulse response $h(t)$ and the input to
   the system $x(t)$ to get $H(\omega)$ and $X(\omega)$ respectively. 
2. Perform the multiplication in the frequency domain: $Y(\omega) =
   H(\omega)X(\omega)$. 
3. Take the inverse Fourier transform $y(t) = \mathcal{F}^{-1} \left(Y (\omega)
   \right)$. 

Now that we have established the relationship between the time and frequency
domains for the impulse function, now is a good time to review properties of
the Fourier transform. 

#### Some properties of the Fourier transform. 

We state the following properties in the below table without proof. 

{{textableinput lectures/lec10/ft-props.csv}}

## Digital implementation
By now we know that almost always, on a computer, functions and signals are all
represented by a list of numbers. Therefore, the discrete version of the
convolution is what gets really implemented:

\nonumber{$$
\left(f \star g \right) [n] = \sum \limits _{m = - \infty} ^{\infty}  f[m]g[n-m]
$$}

Here is a visual example of what that looks like:

\fig{anim-convolute.gif}

As usual, people far smarter than me have worked on making these somewhat
mathematical topics accessible to everyone. In particular, Grant Sanderson has
produced an excellent video on the topic of convolution, that I would
**highly** recommend watching. Moreover, the interested student should
definitely, check out a few other videos that he references (e.g. regarding the
DFT algorithm).

Hopefully, having developed some more intuition about convolution, now let us
turn to the issue of the impulse function in the digital domain. 

#### Impulse function 

Of course the impulse function is an idealization - in fact it is not even a
real function in the mathematical sense, rather we have defined it via the
properties it should have. But this leaves open the question of how to
implement something so idealized on a digital machine. The approach we take is
to ask: "What is a good enough approximation to the impulse function?

The answer, as is often in life, is \highlight{it depends}. In particular, it
depends on the signal/system characteristics that we are analyzing. In the
below figure we plot the magnitude spectrum for a few pulse signals on the
left. The pulses are 1 ms, 2 ms and 5 ms long each and the DFT assumes a
sampling frequency of 1 kHz. We see that only the true discrete impulse
function (1 for the first sample and zero after) has the expected
characteristic. 

\input{plot}{pulse-dft}

Now consider a system whose characteristic is akin to a low pass filter with a
cutoff of 2 Hz. If we zoom-in on the $x$-axis we see that even the 2 ms pulse
can serve as an impulse function over this frequency range. 

#### Convolution
In MATLAB there are two functions that implement convolution. There are the
`conv` and `filter` functions with the latter being a far more general
function. For the former, the function signature is as follows:

```matlab
y = conv(x, h, 'shape')
```

where `x` and `h` are the input signals and `shape` is a parameter that
specifies what the output should [look
like](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/conv.html#bucr8kb-1-shape).

| Parameter | Output length | Function |
|-----------|---------------|----------|
| `full`    | $l_x +l_h -1$ | Zero pads as necessary |
| `same`    | $l_x$         | Zero pads but only returns central sum |
| `valid`   | $l_x -l_h -1$ | No zero padding |

Note that in either cases the output will require normalization by the length
of samples. 

### Code examples

Consider the following MATLAB code:

\input{matlab}{conv_ex.m}

and carefully observe the output:

\output{conv_ex}

As you can see, only the `full` (default) mode of convolution preserves its
commutativity. The equivalent of `conv(h, x)` using the `filter` command in 
MATLAB is `filter(h, 1, x)`. 

#### Convolution/multiplication relation 

We remarked that convolution in the time domain is equivalent to multiplication
in the frequency domain. This below example, based on CSSB Example 5.7 shows that 
this is indeed the case. Clicking on the image will get you the code that
generated it for the website, and in [Chapter
5](/code/#links_to_colab_notebooks) you can find the Python code. 

[\input{plot}{conv-fft-compare}](/assets/lectures/lec10/code/conv-fft-compare.jl)

The equivalent MATLAB code from CSSB is shown below for completeness sake. 

\input{matlab}{Ex5_7.m}

\note{With regards to implementation, remember that everything on a computer is
done using DFT and that the DFT assumes periodicity of the input sequences.
Therefore, on a computer the equivalence or relation between convolution in the
time domain and multiplication in the Fourier domain holds proper for _circular
convolution_. To see this in action, simply try adding a time shift of $\pi/2$
to the sawtooth wave in the above code and look at the output. To know more
about this very common source of error: [go
here](https://www.mathworks.com/help/signal/ug/linear-and-circular-convolution.html).}


### Filtering using convolution
Considering our discussion of digital or discrete convolution above, it is
straightforward to note that whenever one of the sequences $f[n]$ or $g[m]$ is
a constant, we end up performing some sort of weighted averaging. In
particular, when the constants are $\dfrac{1}{n}$ or $\dfrac{1}{m}$ we get an
$n$ or $m$ point _moving_ average if the sequences $f$ and $g$ are also of
length $n$ or $m$ respectively as shown in below figure (you are encouraged to
write down the MATLAB version of the code). 

```julia:conv-filter
using DSP, Plots # hide
N, t = 10, 0:0.01:2Ï€ 		# We are taking N=10 point average  
f(t) = sin(t) + rand()		# Generates a noisy sinusoid
plot(t, f.(t), label="Noisy sine") 	# Plots it
z(t) = conv(f.(t), repeat([1/N],N))	# Convolve with a constant vector

# Convolution result may be different length than time vector 
# but result is still on [0, 2Ï€]

plot!(LinRange(0, 2Ï€, length(z(t))), z(t), label="Smoothened sine", 
	title="Taking 10 point average")
savefig(joinpath(@OUTPUT, "conv-filter")) # hide
```
