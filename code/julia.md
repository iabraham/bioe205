# Julia

Are you curious about the Julia language that was used to create the course
webapage? [Julia](https://julialang.org) is an up and coming language that 
is being widely adopted: both in [academia](https://julialang.org/learning/classes/), 
[industry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_(programming_language)#Adoption) and elsewhere around [the
world](https://juliahub.com/case-studies/). It will not replace MATLAB (or
Python) any time soon, but it is being actively developed with a lot of
interesting & promising features. 

This page shows a few examples from the text converted to Julia code. Compare
the outputs with the textbook images and the code samples to get a feel for
Julia if interested. 

To see more of Julia in action check out [this
course](https://computationalthinking.mit.edu/) from MIT.
