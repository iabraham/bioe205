# Code examples

The
[website](https://www.elsevier.com/books-and-journals/book-companion/9780128093955)
for our required textbook provides links to freely download MATLAB code for examples
presented in the textbook. This page links to Google Colaboratory notebooks
that recreate the same freely available examples in Python. 

> **NOTE:** You are **free** to use MATLAB or Python for this course.

## Rationale
While our required textbook (and to a large extent this course) primarily uses
MATLAB & Simulink, it is no secret that the necessary software licenses can be
expensive to obtain. Furthermore, using MATLAB remotely via Citrix can be a
finicky affair on a less than stellar internet connection. 

On the other hand, Python is free, open source and lingua franca for all
sorts of machine learning (ML) and artificial (AI) applications currently.
Knowing some Python will always be a plus and thus â€¦ this page[^1]. 


## How to Colab?
To get started with Python notebooks in the cloud, visit this
[link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1xjRdhTa6O7gQ_CJL561H5CobB3zMa7Aj?usp=sharing)
and click "Copy to Drive" after signing in with 
[Google Apps @
Illinois](https://help.uillinois.edu/TDClient/42/UIUC/Requests/ServiceDet?ID=135)
account. 

If the link reports that you need to request access, make sure you are
**signed in with your Google Apps @ Illinois account.** Clicking "Request
Access" will **NOT** give you access. [See here.](/reqaccess)

If you are already signed in, but the link reports 
that file cannot be previewed then click "Open with Colaboratory". 

## Links to Colab notebooks

Note that in many of these notebooks the necessary `.mat` files must be uploaded
to the Colab runtime for the notebook to run. These files can be found at the
companion website for the textbook.

[^1]: Admittedly, there are no comparable open-source pain-free alternatives to Simulink and therefore for material relying on Simulink, we will wholly use Simulink.
