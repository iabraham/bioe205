# Homework Instructions
Use entry code **Y78NW2** to add the course on [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/) where you will be submitting assignments. Best practice is to use your Illinois e-mail ID to make an account.
Read about how to submit assignments on Gradescope [here](https://help.gradescope.com/article/ccbpppziu9-student-submit-work). Some pointers:

* Make sure your written work is legible. If TAs cannot read your work, they cannot grade it. They may ask you to resubmit or dock points off.
* Do upload high quality PDF scans; most modern smartphones have a document scanning functionality. For example: [iOS](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT209037) & [Android](https://www.howtogeek.com/166610/who-needs-a-scanner-scan-a-document-to-pdf-with-your-android-phone/).
* Make sure to use the tools in Gradescope to mark where in your upload the answer to each question can be found.
* One good practice is to start each question on a new page.
* For a multi-page answer, associate all relevant pages with the question.
* When plotting functions, use a computer program like MATLAB or a ruler and graph paper. Include a title and axes labels on all plots.
* Include units where appropriate.

Also note:

* The standard expectations on [academic integrity](/syllabus#academic_conduct) apply. Your work must be your own.
* **The deadline is before class on the due date.**
* Deadlines will be set for each assignment on Gradescope. **No late submission will be accepted.**
